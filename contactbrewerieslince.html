    <h2>ABOUT LINCE</h2>
        <p>António Carriço and Pedro Vieira met at Vodafone where they both worked and became friends. They were responsible for several services and systems that were part of the daily lives of many Portuguese, including the internet service “netc".</p>
        <p>Later, Adão Coelho, a professional in the trade marketing area in the beverage sector, and also, passionate about craft beer and lynx.</p>
        <p>Lince's first homemade productions started in a garage with very basic equipment. With the retirement age approaching, but still with the spirit of innovation always present and the will and the energy to want to do something different, António and Pedro decided that the time had come to take the "leap" towards a professional production. Both wanted a Portuguese animal to be the "face" and the inspiration of this whole project, but above all they wanted the appeal of this brand to exist in the genetic code of this brand, a cause.</p>
