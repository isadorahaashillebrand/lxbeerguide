            <h2>ABOUT MUSA</h2>
            <p>While on a road trip somewhere in between Portugal’s birthplace and the country’s de facto capital, Bruno
                and Nuno
                (whose rhyming names are no coincidence) decided it was time for people to savour even better beer in
                Portugal.</p>
            <p>The quickly came to the realization that the road was the only way to move their idea forward. from there
                onwards,
                many miles were travelled with a sole objective: to televise the revolution (apologies gil scott) of
                craft beer
                around the world.</p>
            <p>Sick breweries were visited, long conversations were had, and, most of all, heaps of beers were consumed.
                however,
                their pet project was missing a crucial link – a brewer. Thankfully, after an arduous search they were
                not able to
                find a brewer, but rather had to content themselves with the brewer. nick, ‘the viking’ leaves -20ºc
                pittsburgh and
                lands in sunny, +15ºc lisbon, and despite the dazzling thermal shock, he was rapidly convinced. </p>
            <p>The recipe for Musa was found, and, in 2016, the first batch is brewed. the world you once knew will
                never be the
                same. especially after midday.</p>
