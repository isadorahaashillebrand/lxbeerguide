    <h2>ABOUT MUSA</h2>
        <p>While on a road trip somewhere in between Portugal’s birthplace and the country’s de facto capital, Bruno and Nuno (whose rhyming names are no coincidence) decided it was time for people to savour even better beer in Portugal.</p>
        <p>The quickly came to the realization that the road was the only way to move their idea forward. from there onwards, many miles were travelled with a sole objective: to televise the revolution (apologies gil scott) of craft beer around the world.</p>
        <p>Sick breweries were visited, long conversations were had, and, most of all, heaps of beers were consumed. however, their pet project was missing a crucial link – a brewer. Thankfully, after an arduous search they were not able to find a brewer, but rather had to content themselves with the brewer. nick, ‘the viking’ leaves -20ºc pittsburgh and lands in sunny, +15ºc lisbon, and despite the dazzling thermal shock, he was rapidly convinced. </p>
        <p>The recipe for Musa was found, and, in 2016, the first batch is brewed. the world you once knew will never be the same. especially after midday.</p>
