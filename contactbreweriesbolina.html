    <h2>ABOUT BOLINA</h2>
        <p>Everything has a beginning and Bolina beer is not the norm. Many good and less good times were worth living and overcoming so we can tell this story. Some of you were part of it, others will still be, but in general, we count on everyone to keep the story going...</p>
        <p>Currently, the company employs three employees, in addition to partners, (Emanuel, Rita and Tiago) and has a capacity of approximately 100 thousand liters per year. Initially, out of half a dozen craft brewers, Bolina is today one of over 150 craft beer brands in Portugal.</p>
        <p>It is worth mentioning and because it deserves particular relevance, that we have made our facilities available for the development of academic works, at the level of secondary education, which have stood out, for having won national and international awards.</p>
